-------

The main section includes files from the original repository, as well as files from a branch (https://github.com/alamgirqazi/prompting_hate_speech).
The reproduced code is included in the ANLP_indiv_project folder.

The ANLP_indiv_project folder includes:
1. Google Colab Notebooks for data preprocessing, RoBERTa-Base Fine Tuning, and model Zero-Shot Learning.
2. Folder of results (checkpoints) from last fine tuning run.
3. Preprocessed datasets used in the reproduction.
